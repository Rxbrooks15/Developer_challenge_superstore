# Developer_challenge_superstore
Produced 2 visualizations based on the superstore dataset. After looking within the csv, I figured a great deal of the visualization would involve numerical values based on the total profits and sales. 

After finally concluding the choropleth visualizations, I found it hard to choose between this visualization and Screenshot (11) since 
the other graph contains slightly differnt legend values and highlighted more negative values. Because of the wide range of values within the data set and overall more values being positive,  I chose to go with larger range of values for the legend producing a more gradual shift between range values.

Finally, I created a second visual of superstore.csv with toggle features allowing users to view 4 unique graphs based on the toggle button clicked. With this, an animation feature was implimented to create a subtle transition between the changing phrases of the graphs. I had a hard time changing the axes but later implimented functions to update the x axis to the 0 value of the y-axis.
