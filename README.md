# Developer_challenge_superstore


**Objective:**
Perform the needed data cleaning steps to visualize data from superstore.csv in D3
Analyze the data and create visualizations that summarize the data without having looked at the data. 

**Process:**
Produced 2 visualizations based on the superstore dataset. After looking within the csv, I figured a great deal of the visualization would involve numerical values based on the total profits and sales. I calculated the total Profits based on each state and produced a color pallete to create distinctions between profit values. 

**Conclusion:** After producing the data visualization I noted that the 3 major states with the highest profit were New York, California, and Michigan while the 3 states with the lowest profit were Texas, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Additionally, with the hover function, users can view the values of a state's quantity of products, average discount values and sales values. 

**Challenges:** After finally concluding the choropleth visualizations, I found it hard to choose between this visualization and Screenshot (11) since 
the other graph contains slightly differnt legend values and highlighted more negative values. Because of the wide range of values within the data set and overall more values being positive,  I chose to go with larger range of values for the legend producing a more gradual shift between range values.

Finally, I created a second visual of superstore.csv with toggle features allowing users to view 4 unique graphs based on the toggle button clicked. With this, an animation feature was implimented to create a subtle transition between the changing phrases of the graphs. I had a hard time changing the axes but later implimented functions to update the x axis to the 0 value of the y-axis.
